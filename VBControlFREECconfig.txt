[general]

##parameters chrLenFile and ploidy are required.
#on local machine run the scp command
#scp GCA_000182925.2_NC12_genomic.fna ry00555@xfer.gacrc.uga.edu:/home/ry00555/Bioinformatics
#in Bioinformatics Folder convert .fna to .fa.fai
#cp GCA_000182925.2_NC12_genomic.fna GCA_000182925.2_NC12_genomic.fa.fai

chrLenFile = /home/ry00555/Bioinformatics/GCA_000182925.2_NC12_genomic.fa.fai

ploidy = 1
#use ploidy=2 if you caught your mold in the diploid phqse


##Parameter "breakPointThreshold" specifies the maximal slope of the slope of residual sum of squares.
##This should be a positive value. The closer it is to Zero, the more breakpoints will be called. Its recommended value is between 0.01 and 0.08.

#TRY TO RUN FREEC WITH THE DEFAULT PARAMETERS FIRST. DECREASE/INCREASE THE THERESHOLD ONLY IF YOU ARE NOT HAPPY WITH THE PROPOSED NUMBER OF BREAKPOINT (FROM VISUAL INSPECTION OF THE OUTPUT)
#breakPointThreshold = 0.6


##Either coefficientOfVariation or window must be specified for whole genome sequencing data. Set window=0 for exome sequencing data.

#HERE LET FREEC DETERMINE THE WINDOW ITSELF BASED ON THE DEFAULT VALUE OF THE COEFFICIENT OF VARIATION (0.06 I GUESS)
#coefficientOfVariation = 0.01
#window = 50000
#step=10000

##Either chrFiles or GCcontentProfile must be specified too if no control dataset is available.
##If you provide a path to chromosome files, Control-FREEC will look for the following fasta files in your directory (in this order):
##1, 1.fa, 1.fasta, chr1.fa, chr1.fasta; 2, 2.fa, etc.
## Please ensure that you don't have other files but sequences having the listed names in this directory.
chrFiles = /home/ry00555/Bioinformatics/GCA_000182925.2_NC12_genomic.fa.fai/
#GCcontentProfile = /home/ry00555/Bioinformatics/GCA_000182925.2_NC12_genomic.fa.fai/GC_profile_50000.cnp

#THIS MAY BE VERY IMPORTANT FOR YOU TO SET CORRECTLY. HOW GC-RICH IS THE GENOME? YOU CAN RUN FREEC ONCE AND THEN SIMPLY LOOK AT THE DISTRIBUTION OF VALUES IN THE GC_profile_xxx.cnp WHICH WILL BE CREATED
##if you are working with something non-human, we may need to modify these parameters:
#minExpectedGC = 0.35
#maxExpectedGC = 0.55


#readCountThreshold=10

#numberOfProcesses = 4
#outputDir = test
#contaminationAdjustment = TRUE
#contamination = 0.4
#minMappabilityPerWindow = 0.95


##If the parameter gemMappabilityFile is not specified, then the fraction of non-N nucleotides per window is used as Mappability.

#gemMappabilityFile = /home/ry00555/Bioinformatics/GEM_mappability/out76.gem


#breakPointType = 4
#forceGCcontentNormalization = 0
#sex=XY

##set BedGraphOutput=TRUE if you want to create a BedGraph track for visualization in the UCSC genome browser:
#BedGraphOutput=TRUE

[sample]

mateFile = /path/sample.bam
#mateCopyNumberFile = test/sample.cpn
inputFormat = BAM
mateOrientation = RF

##use "mateOrientation=0" for sorted .SAM and .BAM

[control]

#mateFile = /home/ry00555/Bioinformatics/control.pileup.gz
#mateCopyNumberFile = /home/ry00555/Bioinformatics/control.cpn
#inputFormat = pileup


#mateOrientation = RF

#[BAF]

##use the following options to calculate B allele frequency profiles and genotype status. This option can only be used if "inputFormat=pileup"

#SNPfile =
#minimalCoveragePerPosition = 5

##use "minimalQualityPerPosition" and "shiftInQuality" to consider only high quality position in calculation of allelic frequencies (this option significantly slows down reading of .pileup)

#minimalQualityPerPosition = 5
#shiftInQuality = 33

[target]

##use a tab-delimited .BED file to specify capture regions (control dataset is needed to use this option):

#captureRegions = /home/ry00555/Bioinformatics/
